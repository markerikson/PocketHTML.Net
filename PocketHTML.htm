<!-- *****Topic Break**** --><a name="intro"></a><strong>Introduction</strong> <br>
<br>
<p>Welcome to PocketHTML.Net, the premier HTML editor for the PocketPC (abbreviated to PHN in this help file).  PHN is designed to make editing HTML pages as simple as possible while reducing the amount of taps and writing.  It's useful for website design, lists, rich text-style documents, and much more. </p>

<p>My goal is that you be completely satisfied with PHN.  If you have a problem, find a bug, or have a comment, please e-mail me at <a href="mailto:mark@isquaredsoftware.com">mark@isquaredsoftware.com</a> and I'll get back to you as soon as possible.  I also enjoy finding out who's using my software and what they're using it for.</p>

<p>Thanks for using PocketHTML.Net!</p>

<!-- ************************Topic Break************************* --><a name="buttons"></a><strong>Toolbar Buttons</strong> <br>
<br>
<p>PHN has only two buttons on its toolbar.  The left button, "&lt; &gt;", brings up the tag insertion menu.  This is described in more detail in the section "Tag Insertion".  The right toolbar button, "IE", displays the currently edited file in the integrated HTML viewer.  Tap the "IE" button to switch to preview mode; tap it again to switch back to HTML editing.</p>

<a name="config"></a><strong>Configuration File</strong> <br>
<br>
<p>The configuration file (pockethtml.ini) has two main sections.  It holds the values for initializing the QuickTag buttons, and it holds the main program options. It's a plain text file, so open it in something like Pocket Notepad from Tillanosoft. It's pretty self explanatory. The only thing to remember is that if a short name is provided for a tag in the tags.csv file, then you'll need to use that in the pockethtml.ini file.</p>

<!-- ************************Topic Break************************* --><a name="options"></a><strong>Options Menu</strong> 
<p>The checkboxes control the main program options.  They are:</p>

<br>
<br>
<p>"Wrap editor text": Controls wordwrap in the text editor.<br>
 "Wrap page preview": Controls wordwrap in the integrated HTML viewer.<br>
 "Indent HTML tags": If on, tags inside default inner tags (such as the &lt;LI&gt; inside &lt;OL&gt;) will be inserted with a 4-space indent.<br>
 "Autoindent on Enter": If the Enter key is tapped when on, a new line is inserted and the cursor automatically indented to the same depth it is on the current line.  If not, a new line is inserted and the cursor is placed at the start of the line.<br>
 "XHTML-style single tags": In standard HTML, a single tag such as &lt;BR&gt; does not need a closing tag or slash.  Under XHTML, a tag such as &lt;BR&gt; must be written as &lt;BR /&gt;.  If this is on, XHTML-style tags will be generated.<br>
 "Use ClearType" in preview: Controls the use of ClearType in the integrated HTML viewer.</p>

<p>The QuickTag section allows you to set what each QuickTag button inserts.  The buttons are numbered 1-16, with 1-8 on the top row and 9-16 on the bottom. </p>

<a name="taginsertion"></a><strong>Tag Insertion</strong> 
<p>Writing HTML tags on a PocketPC is extremely repetitive and tiring. PHN makes this easier in two ways: the tag insertion menu, and the QuickTag buttons.</p>

<p>To activate the tag insertion menu, either click the "&lt; &gt;" icon in the tool bar, or tap and hold inside the textbox. Just tap through the menu for the tag you want.</p>

<p>The customizable QuickTag buttons let you put the tags you use most at your fingertips. One tap-insertion makes writing HTML far easier. The buttons are configured in the Options menu.</p>

<p>Note that if you insert a tag through the toolbar icon while text is selected, the selected text will be placed inside the tags.  At the moment this is impossible to do via tap-and-hold, since the text is deselected.  This appears to be a bug in the Compact Framework and will hopefully be resolved in the next Service Pack.</p>

<a name="history"></a><strong>Version History</strong> 
<p>1.1: Now takes advantage of Tillanosoft's tGetFile.dll if it exists on the system - far superior to Microsoft's built-in open/save dialogs.<br>
<br>
 1.02: Additional fixes for the DirectoryNotFoundException error, particularly when dealing with storage cards. Hopefully it's all fixed now.<br>
<br>
 1.01: Fixed a hardcoded directory string which was causing PHN to crash on load when not installed to \Program Files\PocketHTML.Net .<br>
<br>
 1.00: Initial release.</p>
