<p><a name="intro"></a><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Welcome to PocketHTML.Net, the premier HTML editor for the PocketPC.  PocketHTML is designed to make 
editing HTML pages as simple as possible while reducing the amount of taps and writing.  It's useful for 
website design, lists, rich text-style documents, and much more. </p>

<p>My goal is that you be completely satisfied with PHN.  If you have a problem, find a bug, or have 
a comment, please e-mail me at <a href="mailto:mark@isquaredsoftware.com">mark@isquaredsoftware.com</a> 
and I'll get back to you as soon as possible.</p>

<p><a name="buttons"></a><strong>Toolbar Buttons</strong></p>
<p>PHN has only two buttons on its toolbar.  The left button, "&lt; &gt;", brings up the tag 
insertion menu.  This is described in more detail in the section "Tag Insertion".  The right 
toolbar button, "IE", displays the currently edited file in the integrated HTML viewer.  Tap 
the "IE" button to switch to preview mode; tap it again to switch back to HTML editing.</p>

<p><a name="menus"></a><strong>Menus</strong></p>
<p><em>File</em></p>
<p>Most items on the File menu should be self-explanatory.  The "New" item gives a list of options for a 
file.  "Blank" is an empty file, while "Basic" has just HTML and Body tags.  Also, any 
<a href="PocketHTML.htm#templates">template files</a> are listed here.</p>

<p><em>Edit</em></p>
<p>The Edit menu includes the usual clipboard operations, Undo, Clear, Select All, and access to the
Find and Replace dialogs.</p>

<p><em>Tools</em></p>
<ul>
	<li>"Options": shows the Options dialog</li>
	<li>"Launch Tag Editor": Starts the included <a href="PocketHTML.htm#tageditor">Tag Editor</a>, which 
	lets you edit the definitions of	HTML tags and the structure of the popup tag menu.</li>
	<li>"Refresh Tags": Reloads the tag files from disk.  Do this if you've made any changes
	using the Tag Editor.</li>
	<li>"Refresh Templates": Updates the list of template files shown in "File &gt; New".</li>
	<li>"Indent / Unindent Text": Indents and unindents text by a single tab, based on the 
	current location of the cursor.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Help</em></p>
<p>"About" shows the About PocketHTML screen, and "Contents" shows this help file.</p>

<!-- ************************Topic Break************************* -->
<p><a name="options"></a><strong>Options Dialog</strong></p>
<p>The Options dialog is divided into two main sections: Program Options and QuickTag setup.</p>
<p><em>Program Options</em></p>
<p>The main options for PocketHTML include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>"Wrap editor text": Controls wordwrap in the text editor.</li>
	<li>"Wrap page preview": Controls wordwrap in the integrated HTML viewer.</li>
	<li>"Indent HTML tags": If on, tags inside default inner tags (such as the &lt;li&gt; 
	inside &lt;ol&gt;) will be inserted with a 1-tab / 4-space indent.</li>
	<li>"Autoindent on Enter": If the Enter key is tapped when on, a new line is inserted and 
	the cursor automatically indented to the same depth it is on the current line.  If not, a 
	new line is inserted and the cursor is placed at the start of the line.</li>
	<li>"XHTML-style single tags": In standard HTML, a single tag such as &lt;br&gt; does not 
	need a closing tag or slash.  Under XHTML, a tag such as &lt;br&gt; must be written as &lt;br /&gt;.  
	If this is on, XHTML-style tags will be generated.</li>
	<li>"Use ClearType" in preview: Controls the use of ClearType in the integrated HTML viewer.</li>
	<li>"Use monospaced font": Controls whether or not a monospaced font is used in the text editor.</li>
	<li>"Preview zoom level": Controls the zoom level for the integrated HTML viewer.  A higher number
	means more zoom.  The default is 1.</li>
	<li>"Default text encoding": Selects the text encoding that PocketHTML uses when trying to load
	or save a file.  When loading a file, PocketHTML checks the text for the Meta tag "contents".  If this
	tag exists, then PocketHTML tries to use that charset to load the file.  Otherwise, the encoding
	specified by this value is used.  You can use the "Test" button to check if a given encoding
	is available on your device.  The default encoding is Unicode (UTF-8).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>QuickTags setup</em></p>
<p>The QuickTag section allows you to set what each QuickTag button inserts.  The buttons are numbered 
1-16, with 1-8 on the top row and 9-16 on the bottom.  Selecting a button number from the left 
dropdown shows which tag is currently assigned to that button.  A different tag can be selected
using the right dropdown.</p>
<p>A hardware button can be assigned to show the popup tag menu.  Use the number control to select
which button is used.</p>

<!-- ************************Topic Break************************* -->
<p><a name="tageditor"></a><strong>Tag Editor</strong></p>
<p>The information for each HTML tag is stored in an external file.  In previous versions of 
PocketHTML, this file was called tags.csv.  While it was possible to edit this file manually,
the format was not well documented and hard to read.  In addition, since the structure of the
popup tag menu was built into the program, newly added items could only be assigned to 
QuickTag buttons.</p>
<p>In version 1.2, tag information is now stored in tags.xml.  This file is human-readable and
much easier to edit.  Also, the structure of the tag menu is based on the file menu.xml.  This
means that new items can be added to the tag menu.</p>
<p>While these files can be edited by hand, a Tag Editor has been created to make editing these
things easier.  The Tag Editor can add, delete, and edit HTML tag definitions, as well as 
edit the structure of the tag menu.</p>
<p>PocketHTML and the Tag Editor share the same tags.xml and menu.xml files.  Both of them
read these files at startup.  Because the Tag Editor is usually launched from within PocketHTML,
changes made by the Tag Editor are not automatically available in PocketHTML.  You must select
"Refresh Tags" from PocketHTML's Tools menu to reload the changed files.</p>
<p>Please note that if either tags.xml or menu.xml is malformed, PocketHTML may not load properly.</p>
<p><em>Tag Definition</em></p>
<p>Each HTML tag is made up of several pieces of information</p>
<ul>
	<li>A display name, which is shown in the tag menu and used as the unique identifier for the tag.</li>
	<li>A value, which is the actual text for the tag.</li>
	<li>An optional short name, which is displayed on the QuickTag buttons if the display name doesn't fit</li>
	<li>An optional inner tag, which is inserted inside the main tag (for example, the &lt;;i&gt; 
	inside &lt;ol&gt;).</li>
</ul>
<p>A tag definition also includes whether or not a closing tag is required, whether or not the 
tag should be split across multiple lines, and whether or not angle brackets need to be put 
around the tag's value.  Finally, a tag can have attributes.</p>
<p>The display name, value, and short name are simply typed into the appropriate textboxes.  If the value
is too long to easily fit into the textbox, tap the "..." button next to it to bring up a larger
input dialog.  An inner tag can be selected from the dropdown list.  Attributes should be typed into
the Attributes textbox, one attribute per line, including any default values (see the "Button" tag 
definition for examples).  Tags can be previewed using the "Preview Tag" button at the bottom of the
section.</p>
<p>Please note that tag definitions are saved using the "Save Tag" item in the Tags menu.  However,
any changes do not fully take place until you select "Save files" from the File menu.</p>

<p><em>Tag Menu Structure</em></p>
<p>The layout for the popup tag menu can be edited using the Tag Menu tab.  The main section of this
screen shows the current hierarchy of menu items.  Selected items can be moved around using the 
"Left / Up / Down / Right" buttons near the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>Menu items may be added and deleted using the "Tag Menu" menu.  You can select which tag is assigned
to a menu item by tapping-and-holding on it, then choosing "Select Tag".  You can also designate a
menu item as a separator or as a parent heading.  If you designate a menu item as a heading and give
it a name, make sure that you place other menu items under it.</p>
<p>The current menu structure can be previewed by choosing "Preview Menu" from the Tags Menu menu, and 
validated by choosing the "Validate Menu" option.  This does a simple check to make sure that each menu
item is either a valid tag, a separator, or a heading item with other menu items inside.</p>

<p><a name="taginsertion"></a><strong>Tag Insertion</strong> </p>
<p>Writing HTML tags on a PocketPC is extremely repetitive and tiring. PHN makes this easier in 
two ways: the tag insertion menu, and the QuickTag buttons.</p>

<p>To activate the tag insertion menu, either click the "&lt; &gt;" icon in the tool bar, 
tap-and-hold inside the textbox, or press the appropriate hardware button (if enabled in the
Options dialog). Just tap through the menu for the tag you want.</p>

<p>The customizable QuickTag buttons let you put the tags you use most at your fingertips. 
One tap-insertion makes writing HTML far easier. The buttons are configured in the Options menu.</p>

<p>Note that if you insert a tag through the toolbar icon while text is selected, the selected 
text will be placed inside the tags.  You can also tap-and-hold on the selected text to bring up
the tag menu.  Previous versions of the .Net Compact Framework had a bug that made it impossible
to tap-and-hold selected text, but this was fixed in CF Service Pack 3.</p>

<hr>
<!-- ************************Topic Break************************* -->
<p><a name="templates"></a><strong>Template Files</strong></p>
<p>Template files are simply HTML files that are loaded as new files.  On startup, 
PocketHTML checks the PocketHTML.Net\Templates directory for any HTML files, and adds 
each one to the list of items under "File &gt; New".  When a template file is selected,
the file is loaded, but no filename is associated with the text (in other words, saving
the file will not automatically overwrite the template).  To add a template file, just
save a new file into the \Templates directory.  To update the list of templates, select
"Refresh Templates" from the Tools menu.</p>

<!-- ************************Topic Break************************* -->
<p><a name="filestructures"></a><strong>XML File Structures</strong></p>
<p>While the Tag Editor is the preferred method for editing menu.xml and tags.xml, they
can also be edited by hand.  The structure for each file is defined as follows:</p>
<p><em>menu.xml</em></p>
<p>Menu.xml contains a single &lt;menuitems&gt; element, which contains one or more
&lt;menuitem&gt; elements.  Each menuitem may contain other menuitems, which may be
nested arbitrarily deep.  Each menuitem has a single attribute, "name".  This is the
display name of the tag associated with that menu item.  If the menu item has children,
then the name attribute is just a heading instead of a tag name.</p>
<p><em>tags.xml</em></p>
<p>Tags.xml contains a single &lt;TagList&gt; element, which contains one or more
&lt;Tag&gt; elements.  Each tag has several required attributes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>DisplayName: the text displayed in the tag menu.</li>
	<li>Value: the actual text of the tag (ie, what goes between the < >).</li>
	<li>AngleBrackets: whether or not the item has angle brackets around it.  This is 
	"true" for almost all actual HTML tags, and is usually only "false" for items such 
	as character entities (TM, ampersand, etc), Javascript keywords, CSS keywords, 
	and arbitrary chunks of text.</li>
	<li>InnerTag: What tag should be inserted inside this tag.  For example, Ordered List 
	and Unordered List are pointless without at least one List Item inside.</li>
	<li>Shortname: The QuickTag buttons have a limited amount of space to display text.  
	This means that many of the DisplayName values will not fit onto the buttons.  If 
	ShortName has a value, then it will be displayed on the button instead.</li>
	<li>MultiLine: Some tags are generally seen on a single line, such as Bold.  Others, 
	such as Ordered List, are usually seen split across multiple lines.  This value combines 
	with the Default Inner Tag value to define both how the tag is inserted and where the 
	cursor is located afterwards (cursor shown with the | symbol):
	
	<table border=1>
		<tr>
			<td><strong>DIT</strong></td>
			<td><strong>MLT</strong></td>
			<td><strong>Output</strong></td>
		</tr>
		
		<tr>
			<td>Empty</td>
			<td>False</td>
			<td>
<pre>
&lt;tag&gt;|&lt;/tag&gt;</pre>
			</td>
		</tr>
		
		<tr>
			<td>Empty</td>
			<td>True</td>
			<td>
<pre>
&lt;tag&gt;
|
&lt;/tag&gt;</pre>
			</td>
		</tr>
		
		<tr>
			<td>Exists</td>
			<td>False</td>
			<td>
<pre>
&lt;tag&gt;&lt;innertag&gt;|&lt;/innertag&gt;&lt;/tag&gt;</pre>
			</td>
		</tr>
		
		<tr>
			<td>Exists</td>
			<td>True</td>
			<td>
<pre>
&lt;tag&gt;
&lt;innertag&gt;
|
&lt;/innertag&gt;
&lt;/tag&gt;</pre>
			</td>
		</tr>
	
	</table>
	If ClosingTag is "false", this option controls whether or not a new line will be inserted.  
	Also, the Auto-Indent option will affect cursor placement on the given line.
	</li>
	<li>ClosingTag: whether or not the item has a closing tag.  Most items will, items such as 
	Line Break won't.  If this is false, the InnerTag option is ignored.</li>
</ul>
<p>A Tag element may contain an &lt;Attributes&gt; element, which contains one or more
&lt;Attribute&gt; elements.  The text of each Attribute element is a single tag attribute,
including any default values (see the "Button" tag definition for examples).</p>
<p>While the default tags.xml only includes HTML tags, it's also possible to add entries for
other things, such as Javascript keywords, CSS keywords, and frequently used chunks of text.  
Play with the various options to see what works (you'll probably want "Closing Tag", "Multi-Line",
and "Angle Brackets" turned off for these).</p>

<!-- ************************Topic Break************************* -->
<p><a name="config"></a><strong>Configuration File</strong></p>
<p>The configuration file (pockethtml.ini) has three main sections: the main program options,
the names of the tags assigned to the QuickTag buttons, and the list of recently used files.
It's pretty self explanatory.  It's a plain text file, so it can be edited pretty easily.  
However, trying to edit it within PocketHTML may prove a waste of time, because any changes 
made will be overwritten when PocketHTML exits.</p>
