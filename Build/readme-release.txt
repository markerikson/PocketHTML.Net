Thanks for trying PocketHTML.Net, the premier HTML editor for the PocketPC.  Please make sure that the .Net Compact Framework has been installed on your device before continuing this installation.  A link to Microsoft's download page for the Framework can be found on our web site.

PocketHTML.Net is shareware / donationware.  In other words, if you like it, I'd appreciate registration, but it's not required.  This program is fully functional with no limitations.

Comments and suggestions are always appreciated.

Thanks again for trying PocketHTML.Net!


Version History

1.1:
Now takes advantage of Tillanosoft's tGetFile.dll if it exists on the system - far superior to Microsoft's built-in open/save dialogs.

1.02:
Additional fixes for the DirectoryNotFoundException error, particularly when dealing with storage cards.  Hopefully it's all fixed now.

1.01:
Fixed a hardcoded directory string which was causing PHN to crash on load when not installed to \Program Files\PocketHTML.Net .  

1.00:
Initial release.  Yay!
