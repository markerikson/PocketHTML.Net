		<!-- *****Topic Break**** --><a name="intro"></a><b>Introduction</b>
		<P></P>
		<p>Welcome to PocketHTML.Net, the premier HTML editor for the PocketPC (abbreviated 
			to PHN in this help file).&nbsp; PHN is designed to make editing HTML pages as 
			simple as possible while reducing the amount of taps and writing.&nbsp; It's 
			useful for website design, lists, rich text-style documents, and much 
			more.&nbsp;
		</p>
		<P>My goal is that you be completely satisfied with PHN.&nbsp; If you have a 
			problem, find a bug,&nbsp;or have a comment,&nbsp;please e-mail me at <A href="mailto:mark@isquaredsoftware.com">
				mark@isquaredsoftware.com</A>&nbsp;and I'll get back to you as soon as 
			possible.&nbsp; I also enjoy finding out who's using my software and what 
			they're using it for.</P>
		<P>Thanks for using PocketHTML.Net!</P>

			Buttons</b>
		<P></P>
		<p>PHN has only two buttons on its toolbar.&nbsp; The left button, "&lt; &gt;", 
			brings up the tag insertion menu.&nbsp; This is described in more detail in the 
			section "Tag Insertion".&nbsp; The right toolbar button, "IE", displays the 
			currently edited file in the integrated HTML viewer.&nbsp; Tap the "IE" button 
			to switch to preview mode; tap it again to switch back to HTML editing.
		</p>

		<!-- ************************Topic Break************************* -->
		<a name="config"></a><b>Configuration File</b>
		<P></P>
		<p>The configuration file (pockethtml.ini) has two main sections.&nbsp; It holds 
			the values for initializing the QuickTag buttons, and it holds the main program 
			options. It's a plain text file, so open it in something like Pocket Notepad 
			from Tillanosoft. It's pretty self explanatory. The only thing to remember is 
			that if a short name is provided for a tag in the tags.csv file, then you'll 
			need to use that in the pockethtml.ini file.
		</p>
		<!-- PegHelp -->
		<!-- ************************Topic Break************************* --><a name="options"></a><b>Options 
			Menu</b>
		<P>The checkboxes control the main program options.&nbsp; They are:</P>
		<P></P>
		<p>
			"Wrap editor text": Controls wordwrap in the text editor.
			<BR>
			"Wrap page preview": Controls wordwrap in the integrated HTML viewer.<BR>
			"Indent HTML tags": If on, tags inside default inner tags (such as the 
			&lt;LI&gt; inside &lt;OL&gt;) will be inserted with a 4-space indent.<BR>
			"Autoindent on Enter": If the Enter key is tapped when on, a new line is 
			inserted and the cursor automatically indented to the same depth it is on the 
			current line.&nbsp; If not, a new line is inserted and the cursor is placed at 
			the start of the line.<BR>
			"XHTML-style single tags": In standard HTML, a single tag such as &lt;BR&gt; 
			does not need a closing tag or slash.&nbsp; Under XHTML, a tag such as 
			&lt;BR&gt; must be written as &lt;BR /&gt;.&nbsp; If this is on, XHTML-style 
			tags will be generated.<BR>
			"Use ClearType" in preview: Controls the use of ClearType in the integrated 
			HTML viewer.
		</p>
		<P>The QuickTag section allows you to set what each QuickTag button inserts.&nbsp; 
			The buttons are numbered 1-16, with 1-8 on the top row and 9-16 on the 
			bottom.&nbsp;
		</P>

		<a name="taginsertion"></a><b>Tag Insertion</b>
		<p>Writing HTML tags on a PocketPC is extremely repetitive and tiring. PHN makes 
			this easier in two ways: the tag insertion menu, and the QuickTag buttons.
		</p>
		<p>To activate the tag insertion menu, either click the "&lt; &gt;" icon in the 
			tool bar, or tap and hold inside the textbox. Just tap through the menu for the 
			tag you want.</p>
		<p>The customizable QuickTag buttons let you put the tags you use most at your 
			fingertips. One tap-insertion makes writing HTML far easier. The buttons are 
			configured in the Options menu.
		</p>
		<P>Note that if you insert a tag through the toolbar icon while text is selected, 
			the selected text will be placed inside the tags.&nbsp; At the moment this is 
			impossible to do via tap-and-hold, since the text is deselected.&nbsp; This 
			appears to be a bug in the Compact Framework and will hopefully be resolved in 
			the next Service Pack.</P>

		<a name="history"></a><b>Version History</b>
		<p>
			1.1: Now takes advantage of Tillanosoft's tGetFile.dll if it exists on the 
			system - far superior to Microsoft's built-in open/save dialogs.
			<br>
			<br>
			1.02: Additional fixes for the DirectoryNotFoundException error, particularly 
			when dealing with storage cards. Hopefully it's all fixed now.
			<br>
			<br>
			1.01: Fixed a hardcoded directory string which was causing PHN to crash on load 
			when not installed to \Program Files\PocketHTML.Net .
			<br>
			<br>
			1.00: Initial release.
